<h1>Dividend Tracker</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
As I started exploring dividend investing, I realized the importance of studying dividend stocks and their history before making any purchase decisions. One key insight I discovered is that a company's <b>dividend history</b> is a crucial factor for evaluation, yet many stock trading platforms lack easy access to this information.

To address this gap, I created this tool to provide a simple and intuitive way to review dividend histories. To make it beginner-friendly, Iâ€™ve also included a list of S&P 500 stocks as a guideline for those new to dividend investing.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Retrieve Dividend History: Easily fetch dividend data for a specific stock using its ticker symbol.
Interactive Visualization: View dividend trends over time with an interactive graph that includes hover functionality to show exact dates and amounts.</li>
  <li>Beginner Support: Includes an S&P 500 stock list for reference, offering a starting point for those new to dividend investing.</li> 
  <li>Customizable Queries: Input any stock ticker to analyze its dividend history dynamically.</li><br/>
</ul>
<h2>Why I Built This</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Difficulty Accessing Dividend Data: Most trading platforms don't provide comprehensive dividend history in an accessible way.</li>
  <li>Evaluation Criteria for Dividend Stocks: A company's dividend history is a critical checkpoint for investors.</li>
  <li>Beginner Guidance: Many new investors struggle to identify reliable dividend stocks; this tool aims to bridge that gap.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, and install the required libraries:</li>
  <code>pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib</code>
  <li>Run the Script: Input the stock ticker of interest to fetch and visualize dividend data.</li>
  <li>S&P 500 Guidance: Use the included S&P 500 stock list as a reference to start exploring dividend stocks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add support for multiple stock exchanges.</li>
  <li>Enable comparisons of dividend histories for multiple companies.</li>
  <li>Provide additional metrics like dividend yield and payout ratios.</li>
</ul>
